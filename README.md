## Course Abstract

The goal of this course is to provide students with an overview of 
the fields of bioinformatics and computational genomics, and provide
space to acquire basic computer literacy needed to perform analyses of
next generation sequencing experiments. We will attend fundamental 
concepts in the analysis and interpretation of genomics data from bulk
to single-cell technologies, and explore in depth the structure 
properties of key data types and their associated file formats. While we
acknowledge that 6 weeks is far to short a time for this course to be 
considered comprehensive, it is our goal to provide students with basic
skills to empower themselves to advocate for and analyze their own data.

## Course Format

The course takes place over 6 weeks with 1.5 hour lectures on Tuesdays
and Thursdays for a total of 12 lectures and workshops. Most lectures
are accompanied by either readings or some light homework or both. Any
assignments must be completed on time for full credit, no exceptions.
There is no exam.

### Special considerations for COVID-19

Due to social distancing protocols the course will take place online on
MS Teams. Links to be provided by email invite.

## Expectations: Attendance, Homework & Grading

The course is worth 120 points. Late assignments will be given a 
maximum of 50% of full credit up to one lecture *after* the original 
due date. When homework is not assigned, points will be given for 
attendance. Readings are indicated on the syllabus. Each question set 
is worth 10 points and will be graded based on completeness. Links to 
lecture slides and readings will be provided in the syllabi below.

**Attendance is required** no exceptions. You may obtain permission
ahead of time or with extenuating circumstances after the fact from the
graduate school (email to Emma Yates Kassler). Homework assignments are
required on time (see schedule below) regardless of attendance or for
half credit **one lecture late**. Unexcused absences result in an
incomplete grade.
